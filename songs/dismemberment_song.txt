Hold still, my sweet
I'm trying to measure the space between your molar and your jaw
This caliperâ€“ no cause for fear
No, it... it doesn't hurt
It only helps me measure how much skin you have
Oh and the top most layer of fat
But I won't make that insicion 'til you're nice and numb
Oh and laughing as this be so much fun!
Please don't doubt my decision
This will be oooo!
This will be aaaaa!
This will be absolutely weee!
This will be nice!
This will be neat!
This will be neat and bring you closer to me!
So don't you squirm
Don't you fret
I'm not going to hurt you, yet!
I just feel the need to be gettin' a little of you
A lot of blood letting
I know the sensation you're probably dreading
For cutting you up will be so refreshing for me!
Refreshing for me!
No, now don't you cry
And don't call Mariam, she's my alibi
Oh let me check your toes out
Aren't your toenails cute?
And red is such a lovely color on you!
But you wont be needing those!
When you got no knees, or shins, or pinky fingers, or arteries!
So hold still I'll be moved
No, and don't fight back!
I think you'll find you're missing the point with that
That's enough out of you!
This will be oooo!
This will be aaaaa!
This will be absolutely weee!
This will be nice!
This will be neat!
And bring you closer to me!
So don't you squirm!
Don't you fret!
I'm not going to hurt you, yet!
I just feel the need to be gettin' a little of you!
A lot of blood letting
I know the sensation you're probably dreading
But cutting you up will be so refreshing for me!
Refreshing for me!
Well once upon a time that's where the clock begins
And right after the end
Well, that's right where the plot thins
And I've got no angel to keep me in line!
So I'm taking your narrative and I'm making it mine!
'Cuz I'm all out of hurt, you
You used up all I got
So I'm chopping you up
And still coming up squat!
If I wanted to bleed I'd just roll up my sleeves
And saw, and saw
And saw, and saw
And saw, and saw
And saw it, saw it, saw it!
This will be oooo!
This will be aaaaa!
This will be absolutely weee!
This will be nice!
This will be neat!
And bring you closer to me!
So don't you squirm!
Don't you fret!
I'm not going to hurt you
No, no, no, no not yet!
I-I-I-I just feel the need to be gettin' a little of you
A lot of blood letting
I know the sensation you're probably dreading
But there's one thing you're forgetting
There's nothing like the thrill of shredding a mess
There's no war
No dogs beheading in cutting you up
Cutting you up!
Cutting you up is going to be so refreshing for me!
Refreshing for me
Refreshing for me
